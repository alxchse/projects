        We got started on the project and made a few variables, just to get ahead.

        After sitting in the lab for a few hours, we finally finished the project. I ran into many errors with the
        url, which thankfully Sam came by to help me out. Lots of trial and error went into figuring out what was wrong,
        but finally figuring it out felt really good. The map pops up perfectly and shows the distance from my
        house to Athens, Greece.
