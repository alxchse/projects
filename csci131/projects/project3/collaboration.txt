Project 3: Huffman Project

Started on 10/26
    Went to Prof. Walsh office hours to get help with starting the project. He laid out some steps to take
    and helped us with a few codes to get us headed in the right direction. I wrote them down in my computer
    but didn't actually create the project files.

10/30
    I created the files and tried working a little bit but didn't get much done.
    I finished main and did some of LookupCode, but didn't get close to finishing. I was really struggling 
    with the decoding portion. 

11/01
    I worked with Cam and Botamina in the lab. They both pointed out some minor errors in my code,
    but we mostly worked independently. I took a break, and finished up the project by myself from my
    laptop that night. 

11/02
    Decompress.java was not working properly. I went to Prof. Walsh's office hours for extra help.
    Turns out my code-table.txt was empty! Not sure why. Problem is solved, and program works as it should.
    Submitted.
