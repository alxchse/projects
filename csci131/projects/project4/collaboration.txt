Project 4 Collaboration Log

11/14 

I went to Prof. Walsh's office hours in hopes to study for the exam and
get an outline for the project. He threw out some ideas and I made a guideline for myself that night.

Completed the project. Angela Loza helped me come up with the base cases for bucketFill, 
since I was pretty lost. Once I got started, though, it was easy to finish.
