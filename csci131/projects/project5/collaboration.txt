Project 5

12/01
Got bored and started the project on my own. Did some basic stuff, but not too much.
Only made the timer, status box, and help box.

12/02
Went to professor Walsh's office hours for some advice on where to start with the project.
I got a lot done during this time.

12/05
Worked on this project for a few hours alone in the library. I struggled with autoRevealCells
and mouseClicked, but pretty much everything else was done.

12/06
Back at Professor Walsh's office hours. Worked mostly with Botamina, Meghan, Bridget, and Prof. Walsh obviously
Finished up the essentials of the project and submitted.
