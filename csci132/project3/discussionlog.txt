Project 3

20 February 2023

I started working on the project while I was at work. I established a lot of the
variables and came up with some ideas for the functions.

21 February 2023

Carol, Bridget, Angela and I all went to office hours and worked on making the 
functions together. We then spent some time a lot of time after class working 
together. Carol suggested that we use pointers for most of our variables, which 
changed up my code a lot.

I went to office hours and worked with TA Jack, Carol, Angela, Bridget, and Kieran
on finishing up my code.
