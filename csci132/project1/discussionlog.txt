Discusstion Log

Started project and worked for a few hours, mostly establishing any missing variables, creating
pre and post conditions, and outlining to myself what it is each program should do. The most difficult
piece of the project was keeping track of the frequencies of each roll in computeHand. I used an array 
to hold the frequencies originally, but the following if statements proved challenging. Everything else
was nearly, if not completely finished.

I worked away at the 'if' statements in computeHand, but I couldn't find a way to compile the program
without a warning.

My classmates Bridget, Carol, and I decided to go to office hours and finalize our projects. When I showed my errors
to Carol, she suggested I only keep track of the two highest frequencies, rather than keeping my array.
After I did this and cleaned up a few other errors with 'name' and computeHand, my program was finally 
finished.

I added prologues to each of the files and submitted my project.
