Worked on the lab in class and got about halfway done. I did the diagram with Bridget, Carol, and Angela. Most of the code was done in class up to the section called "Making a New Friend."

I worked on the lab by myself for a few hours and got done "Making a New Friend" and "removeCourse" done. I attempted to do the tallies, but I couldn't figure out whether I should have used an ArrayBag or an ArraySet.

Bridget and I worked together on the tallies. After a ton of brainstorming, we finally figured out that we needed to make the <Courses> piece into <Courses*> instead. I finished everything else up just in time.
