Lab 10 Discucssion Log

I worked with Bridget, Carol, TAs Wesley and Jack, and Prof. Fitzsimmons on this lab.


Output for an array of length 6:
Testing Tree Sort for random array:
       9 comparisons per sort, averaged across 100 sortings.
      27 copies per sort, averaged across 100 sortings.

Testing Tree Sort for already-ordered array:
      15 comparisons per sort, averaged across 100 sortings.
      33 copies per sort, averaged across 100 sortings.

Testing Tree Sort for reverse-ordered array:
      15 comparisons per sort, averaged across 100 sortings.
      33 copies per sort, averaged across 100 sortings.

Output for an array of length 25:
Testing Tree Sort for random array:
      97 comparisons per sort, averaged across 100 sortings.
     172 copies per sort, averaged across 100 sortings.

Testing Tree Sort for already-ordered array:
     300 comparisons per sort, averaged across 100 sortings.
     375 copies per sort, averaged across 100 sortings.

Testing Tree Sort for reverse-ordered array:
     300 comparisons per sort, averaged across 100 sortings.
     375 copies per sort, averaged across 100 sortings.

From this, it seems that tree sort is definitely not one of the most efficient programs. It is 
interesting that both the reverse ordered arrays and already ordered arrays take the same
amount of comparisons and copies. It seems that tree sort is most useful for random arrays.
