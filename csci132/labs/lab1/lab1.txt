1. class Student { public: ...}
   Student();                       default constructor
   Student(std::string n, int y);   constructor with name and year of graduation

2. void addCourse(std::string courseName)
   void printCourses(void) const
   void printInfo(void) const
   void setGradDate(int year)

3. string name
   int gradDate
   array courses[6]
   int numCourses

4. "public" is a key word indicating that the class is open for anyone
   access and use the methods within the file. "private" indicates that the methods 
   and variables within it are not available for anyone else to use or edit outside 
   of the class. "private" typically holds variables that should not be manipulated.

5. The Student() and addCourse(std::string courseName) constructors both are stubs
   as they contain information that allows the program to compile and run, though
   not to its entire potential.

6. It is called "s"

7. The two-argument constructor is used to initialize the variable "s" because 
   the parameters are necessary to hold the information about the Student

8. The member conditions called are setGradDate(yr), addCourse(course), printInfo(), 
   and printCourses()

9. When I run register, it crashes saying "linker command failed with exit code 1"

10. Got some help from Prof. Fitzsimmons and the TAs, my program is now running successful!
