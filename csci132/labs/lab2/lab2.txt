Lab 2 Discussion Log

06 Febraury 2023

Started the lab in class. I directly worked with Angela Loza, Bridget Thomson, and Carol Yu.
I also got a lot of help from the TAs and Prof. Fitzsimmons regarding the vectors
and parallel array sets. By the end of lab, my program was almost finished, but still
had a few bugs.

I worked on the add() function within ParallelArraySet. Originally, the program was able
to add a number twice. But after putting the 'return true' statement in the 'if' loop,
the problem was resolved. However, not all integers in the sets were accounted for 
when printing the union set.

I finished the difference() function in test.cpp.
