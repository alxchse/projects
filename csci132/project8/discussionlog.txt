Discussion Log

4/25

I read over the project outline while I was at work.

4/26

I went to TA office hours with Bridget, Carol, Haley, and Angela. We worked on the prime minister
and print ancestors portions together. We got a solid outline done of everything we needed to do, but
had a lot of trouble actually implementing the code. TA Jack helped us.

4/27

I worked with Bridget again on the lab for a few hours before the banquet. I got all of my code done but had
issues deciphering between the TreeNode<Person> objects and where they belonged.

I went to TA office hours with Andrew Sparks, Andres, and Brendan to finish the project. It took a lot of 
trial and error but we finally got it done after a few hours. I also did the extra credit in the lab.
